I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/). Before joining CityU, I obtained my master's degree in Data Science from The University of Edinburgh and my bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. 

My research interests include Fair Division, Computational Social Choice, and Machine Learning.
