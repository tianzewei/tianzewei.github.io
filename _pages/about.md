I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/). Before joining CityU, I obtained my master's degree in Data Science from [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) and my bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn).
