I am an incoming postdoctoral fellow in the [CUHK Business School](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk) at [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/) (CUHK), fortunately mentored by [Wei Tang](https://wtang.org). 
Before this, I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk) (CityUHK), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/), my master's degree in Data Science from [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) and my bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn). I like hiking and running in my spare time.
